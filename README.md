# Music Store
## ReactJS / Context API / Firebase 

Descriptive classNames, Components and a clean CSS Sheet.\
Create-react-app // React-Router-DOM // React-Icons // React useReducer(for cart items and user)\

First I Created the Firestore database, where i hosted images, products, articles, etc.
Requested data to Firebase and displayed it on different Components and Pages.
Created Context and Reducer to move data around the app. ( ex: Request Products in Products Context and passed properties into different components)
